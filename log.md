# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example )
**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)

### Day 1: January 4th, Wednesday 

**Today's Progress**: Understand the `flex` in CSS

**Thoughts**: I think I'm a little bit familiar with the flex. And tomorrow I want to try to built a new SimpleFlexLayout from 0 by my own.
